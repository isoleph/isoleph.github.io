"content": "Tada! You found the hidden note! This note is just like [[Welcome to the garden]], but not part of the feed since we hide it using notetype: unfeed. Please remember that the intention here is only to declutter the feed and not provide any &#39;protection&#39; to the content. Notes with unfeed note type will be synced to Github, accessed via URL, and hyperlinked. How to handle Private notes? . I would recommend using sub-folders inside _notes (Eg: Public and Private) and add Private to .gitignore so that Private notes won&#39;t get synced to Github. PS: Can you see the backlink to Welcome to the garden? That&#39;s backlinking! :) . Here is an example of latex code . iℏ∂∂tΨ(r⃗,t)=H^Ψ(r⃗,t)i \\hbar \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} \\Psi(\\vec{r},t) = \\hat{H} \\Psi(\\vec{r},t)iℏ∂t∂​Ψ(r,t)=H^Ψ(r,t)",

But remember, the point of running a campaign is to uncover the story through your players. You should not be railroading them through a story.
