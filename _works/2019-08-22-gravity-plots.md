This [program](https://github.com/isoleph/proj129) simulates 3 masses in 2 dimensions and graphs the gravitational contours between them. This was initially done with the tkinter library but we preferred to use the matplotlib functionality to do it. The script creates a UI where the mass of each particle can be adjusted using a slider and where its position may also be dragged through the GUI.

This project takes inspiration from this [Maple script](https://climate.ucdavis.edu/GravityProblem.pdf) from UC Davis.
