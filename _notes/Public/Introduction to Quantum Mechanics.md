## The Time-Dependent Schr√∂dinger Equation
$$ i \hbar \frac{\partial}{\partial t} \Psi(\vec{r},t) = \hat{H} \Psi(\vec{r},t) $$
This equation describes a quantum mechanical system under the influence of some voltage; the time evolution of the wavefunction describing the system is dictate by the Hamiltonian, which is an operator with kinetic and potential terms.
